INPUT TEXT
<<<
The hospital's emergency triage protocol requires immediate attention for patients presenting with chest pain, 
unless the pain is clearly musculoskeletal in origin and the patient is under 40 years old. 
Dr. Martinez, who has been working double shifts this week, believes that patients over 65 should always receive an ECG regardless of symptoms, althought Dr. Yang only sometimes believes this.
The official guidelines only mandate this when cardiac history is documented.

      "explanation": "Note,'not' coming before 'clearly' is important. Also note, an initial guess would be `The patient presents with chest pain`. We choose this proposition instead because since it is more specific and is independent from P_3 . The initial guess is captured by P_2 ∨ P_3 "
